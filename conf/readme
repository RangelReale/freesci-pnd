Here's the second attempt at a FreeSCI configuration tool. New features in this version are:

- data structure (as opposed to a zillion global variables)
- game names are no longer hard-coded
- no global resource dir
- help texts explaining the various options (stolen from the man page)
- the script will now look for the template file in both ~/.freesci/ /usr/local/share/ and /usr/share/

The only step necessary for installation: copy config.template to one of the above directories.
