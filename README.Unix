Building FreeSCI
----------------
To build the package, type the following:

0. ./configure

1. make


This will try to build several tools:
src/tools/sciconsole - A command console for inspection of SCI data
src/tools/scidisasm - Disassembles all script resources into .script files
src/tools/sciunpack - A tool for unpacking and converting SCI resource data
		      (now also contains the functionality of the old
		       'classes', 'listwords', 'scriptdump' and 'vocabdump'
		       tools)
src/freesci - The main executable; this loads, links and runs SCI bytecode.

For graphics, you will need at least one of the following:
* An Xlib implementation for the X11 Windowing System,  as shipped with most
  UNIX systems and VMS
* libggi (http://www.ggi-project.org)
* libsdl (http://www.libsdl.org)

To install it on your system (globally), run 'make install'. You will need
to have superuser privileges to do this, unless you specified a different
installation prefix while running 'configure'.


Bulding from Darcs
------------------
If you are using a development snapshot instead of an official release, you
will require the following utilities:

* A C compiler (such as gcc)
* lex or flex
* GNU automake and autoconf
* perl 5.x
* make

Instructions:

0. Checkout the repository or get the source tarball and unpack it.

1. Go into the freesci directory and run autoreconf. (autoreconf -i)

2. Run the configure script. (./configure)

3. Run make. Be sure that /usr/ccs/bin is in your path AFTER /usr/local/bin 
and everything else.


Location of the .freesci directory
----------------------------------
On UNIX systems, a directory called .freesci is created in the home directory
(see README for more details). The home directory is whatever is contained in
your HOME environment variable.


Alpha notes
-----------
FreeSCI on Alpha has one special feature on systems with the MVI instruction
set extension (provided by PCA56, EV6, EV67, and probably all later Alpha
implementations): Using the xlib target in 32bpp mode (read up on the
DefaultFbBpp option in your XF86Config file to find out how to enable this),
you will now get real-time alpha blending.


Solaris notes
-------------
Last updated 04-20-2001 by Matt Hargett <matt@use.net>

Platforms tested:

* Solaris 2.7 w/recommended patches.

Before you run FreeSCI, you MUST add the following line to the config file
(~/.freesci/config): "gfx.xlib.disable_shmem = true".
