Per-resource graphical customisation for SCI games
--------------------------------------------------

Use the %include<> directive or copy and paste the *.scifx files into your
config file (check the README for your platform to find out where it is
located) after the appropriate game section (cf. sample configuration file
in the README) to spice up your graphics just a little bit.
