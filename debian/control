Description: a portable interpreter for SCI games like Space Quest 3
 FreeSCI is a portable interpreter for SCI games, such as the Space Quest
 series (starting with SQ3) or Leisure Suit Larry (2 and sequels).
 .
 FreeSCI is in beta right now; the current release still has several known
 bugs. It is feature-complete within the following limits:
   - Only SCI0 games are supported
   - The SCI debug functions aren't fully supported (and probably never
     will be, since FreeSCI uses its own debug functions).
 .
 It offers the following improvements over Sierra SCI:
   - Improved background picture support
   - Trilinear filtering for text and images
   - readline-like editing in controls
   - General MIDI sound output (still experimental)
