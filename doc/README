FreeSCI: Documentation

In this directory all basic SGML documentation is stored. Other forms of
documentation can be found in the subdirectories 'txt' and 'html'.

The 'misc' subdirectory contains various bits and pieces from all over the
'net, some insightful, others useless.

'man' contains man pages for FreeSCI, donated by Bas Zoetekouw of the
Debian project.
