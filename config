## Example configuration file for FreeSCI
##
## This will slow down FreeSCI considerably, but give you much better graphics.

pic_buffer_size = 4
pic0_brush_mode = more-random
pic_antialiasing = simple
pic0_dither_mode = dither256
pic0_scaled = yes
pic0_line_mode = normal
pic0_dither_pattern = scaled
text_filter = trilinear
cursor_filter = trilinear
pic_filter = trilinear
view_filter = trilinear

## Per-resource graphical customisation: Adjust brightness of some pictures
## a little bit to make the games look nicer.
##
## To get this to work, you will have to copy the scifx files into your
## ~/.freesci subdirectory.
#
# [lsl2]
# %include<lsl2.scifx>
#
# [sq3]
# %include<sq3.scifx>

## Example game: Uncomment this and update it for each of your games.
## The below will allow you to run the game 'FooQuest', whose resources
## are located in '/usr/share/fooquest', by running 'freesci FooQuest'.
## You may want to duplicate this section for all of your games.

# [FooQuest]
#
# resource_dir = /usr/share/fooquest
# version = 0.000.685

## The last line specifies the SCI version to use. If the game doesn't
## behave completely as expected, FreeSCI's version detection may be
## failing; by overriding the game version, you can fix this.
##   To determine the game version, you will first have to find the
## original DOS executable of the SCI game (typically SCIV.EXE), and then
## run 'strings SCIV.EXE | grep 000'.
