FreeSCI does not currently work on DOS; the port is currently orphaned.
The following are the old contents of the README file; most of them no
longer apply.


-------------------

The DOS version of FreeSCI is around the same level of functionality as
the Linux version. The MIDI support is also done (yay!), but it probably
has a lot of bugs.

You'll need this in order to compile FreeSCI/DOS:

 * DJGPP 2 (http://www.delorie.com)
 * libpng (http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png/)
 * zlib (http://www.cdrom.com/infozip/zlib/)

The header files of libpng and zlib must be put in %DJGPP_ROOT%/include, and
the library files in %DJGPP_ROOT%/lib. In order to compile, you'll need to
invoke

set lfn=y
make -fmakefile.dos

To tell make it should use makefile.dos instead of makefile. You *MUST* set
the environment variable LFN to Y (and thus you must compile under Win9x/2000/NT). This is because of the long filenames that are used.

Have fun!
